Because the first distribution N = 2 is only sampling pairs of values from the parent distribution we end up with 5 distinct peaks where the values are sampled either both from within the same parent peak or two different parent peaks resulting in a mean that is between the two parent peaks. This results in much greater variability and a non-normal distribution. The effect of the central limit theorem is weak.\n",
